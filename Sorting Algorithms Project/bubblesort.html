        <h1>Bubble Sort:</h1>
        <div class="box">

            <pre>
        <strong>Definition:</strong>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that
        repeatedly steps through thelist,
        compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong 
        order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm 
        gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top (beginning) of
        the list, while larger elements "sink" to the bottom.</pre>

        <h2>Intuition of Bubble Sort:</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <pre>
<strong>Intuition:</strong>
        Bubble sort works by iteratively stepping through the list of data, comparing two
        adjacent items at a time. If they are in the wrong order, they are swapped. This 
        process repeats, and the largest unsorted element gradually moves to its correct 
        position, similar to bubbles floating to the surface of the water.
        For example following Image:

            <strong>Here is the Java code for Bubble Sort along with an example:</strong>
            <pre>
            import java.util.Arrays;

            public class BubbleSortExample {
                // Method to perform bubble sort
                public static void bubbleSort(int[] array) {
                    int n = array.length;
                    boolean swapped;
                    
                    // Loop through each element in the array
                    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
                        swapped = false;  // Flag to detect if a swap occurred in this iteration
                        
                        // Compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary
                        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                            if (array[j] > array[j + 1]) {
                                // Swap the elements
                                int temp = array[j];
                                array[j] = array[j + 1];
                                array[j + 1] = temp;
                                
                                swapped = true;  // Set flag to true if a swap happened
                            }
                        }
                        
                        // If no swaps occurred, the array is already sorted
                        if (!swapped) break;
                    }
                }

                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    // Example input array
                    int[] array = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8};
                    
                    System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(array));
                    
                    // Call bubble sort method
                    bubbleSort(array);
                    
                    // Output sorted array
                    System.out.println("Sorted array: " + Arrays.toString(array));

           <strong> Let's go through the iterations of the bubble sort step by step for the array [5, 1, 4, 2, 8].</strong>

            Initial Array:
            [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]

            Iteration 1:
            Compare 5 and 1, since 5 > 1, swap them.

            
            [1, 5, 4, 2, 8]
            Compare 5 and 4, since 5 > 4, swap them.

            
            [1, 4, 5, 2, 8]
            Compare 5 and 2, since 5 > 2, swap them.

            
            [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
            Compare 5 and 8, since 5 < 8, no swap is done.
            Array after 1st iteration:


            
            [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
            Iteration 2:
            Compare 1 and 4, since 1 < 4, no swap is done.

            
            [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
            Compare 4 and 2, since 4 > 2, swap them.

           
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            Compare 4 and 5, since 4 < 5, no swap is done.
            Compare 5 and 8, since 5 < 8, no swap is done.
            Array after 2nd iteration:


            
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            Iteration 3:
            Compare 1 and 2, since 1 < 2, no swap is done.

            
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            Compare 2 and 4, since 2 < 4, no swap is done.
            Compare 4 and 5, since 4 < 5, no swap is done.
            Compare 5 and 8, since 5 < 8, no swap is done.
            Array after 3rd iteration:


            
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            Iteration 4:
            Compare 1 and 2, since 1 < 2, no swap is done.
            Compare 2 and 4, since 2 < 4, no swap is done.
            Compare 4 and 5, since 4 < 5, no swap is done.
            Compare 5 and 8, since 5 < 8, no swap is done.
            No swaps occurred in this iteration, so the array is already sorted, and the algorithm stops early.

            Summary of Iterations:
            After the 1st iteration, largest element 8 moved to the end.

            
            [1, 4, 2, 5, 8]
            After the 2nd iteration, second-largest element 5 is in its correct position.

            
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            After the 3rd iteration, no swaps happened, so the array is already sorted.

          
            [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]
            Thus, the array is sorted after a few iterations with the largest elements bubbling up to their correct positions.

            <h2>Time Complexity:</h2>

                <pre>
            <strong>Best Case (when array is already sorted):</strong> O(n)
            <strong>Average Case:</strong>O(n²)
            <strong>Worst Case:</strong> O(n²)
            Since bubble sort compares every adjacent element and can make up to n-1 comparisons per pass,
            it results in a quadratic time complexity for non-optimal cases.

                <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(1) (In-place sorting algorithm)
                Bubble sort requires a constant amount of extra memory space, as it modifies the array directly.

                    <li><strong>Best Case Optimization:</strong> If the array is already sorted, bubble sort can finish
                        early with O(n) time using an optimized version that detects when no swaps are needed.</li>

                        cases, making it impractical for large datasets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Excessive Comparisons:</strong> Even when the list is mostly sorted, bubble sort will
                        still compare adjacent elements unnecessarily unless optimized.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Educational purposes:</strong> Often used to teach basic sorting concepts due to its
                        simplicity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small datasets:</strong> Can be applied when working with very small lists where
                        performance is not a primary concern.</li>
                    <li><strong>Partially sorted data:</strong> Optimized versions of bubble sort can be efficient when
                        the dataset is almost sorted.</li>

                <strong><strong>Note:</strong>While bubble sort is mostly a teaching tool and rarely used in practice
                    for large datasets, its conceptual simplicity helps learners grasp sorting fundamentals
